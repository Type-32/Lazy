It's a client-side minecraft mod that I've been wanting to experiment making ever since I learned how to mod minecraft.

Basically, Hacks.

The name of the mod is an homage to a friend, for anyone who's wondering.

I want to see how deep I can go before slipping my foot and fall to my death.

## Learning Notes

As it turns out, it's not that simple, which is what I expected in the first place.

I'm not going to go down further in developing this mod because I haven't got the time to do so.

Basically, don't use hacks in games. Play fairly.
